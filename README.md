## Features  

### Choose Your Realm  
Start your journey by selecting one of four distinct settings:  
- **Viking:** Brave the harsh northern seas and deal with raiders and gods.  
- **Desert:** Rule a land of endless sand, oases, and ancient secrets.  
- **Kingdom:** Classic medieval governance with knights, castles, and court politics.  
- **Samurai:** Lead with honor in a feudal world of samurai, shoguns, and ancient traditions.  

### Dynamic AI-Generated Events  
Every decision in **Kingdom Game** is shaped by dynamically generated events powered by AI.  
- **Context-Aware Events:** The AI tailors events to your chosen setting, ensuring a unique and immersive experience.  
- **Unpredictable Outcomes:** Decisions can have immediate, delayed, or cascading effects on your resources, adding depth to the gameplay.  
- **Adaptive Challenges:** As the game progresses, the AI introduces events that align with your current resource state, keeping you on your toes.  

### Manage Your Kingdom  
Keep track of four critical resources:  
- **Army:** Protect your kingdom from external threats.  
- **People:** Maintain the happiness and loyalty of your subjects.  
- **Church:** Balance faith and political power.  
- **Wealth:** Grow and sustain your treasury.  

The game ends if any resource reaches its maximum or minimum value, so balance is the key to survival.  

### Decision-Based Gameplay  
- Each event presents a dilemma with two possible choices.  
- Every decision has consequences, impacting your kingdom's resources and overall stability.  

### Endless Replayability  
- The combination of AI-generated events and diverse settings ensures that no two playthroughs are the same.
